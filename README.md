# Project: Business Intelligence with Tableau

I used a data set with the global and regional sales of video games from 1981 until 2016.

I created the following sheets:
    - Gross Global sell per Developer.    
    - Sells 30- Global-EU-JP-NA-Others.
    - Best Seller Games by Genre.
    - Gross Sales per Year/Genre.
    - 40 best games.
    - Gross Sales per Genre and Developer.
    - Proportion of sales by region.
    
## Conclutions

Our sales conclusion is that Nintendo, EA, and Ubisoft have the best global sales. Most video game sales in a period of time were between 2001-2015. The games most produced by the company are Action, Sports, and Shooter. The bests games sell are Wii Sports, Grand Theft Auto V, and Super Mario Bros. In the base of the gross sales by genre per developer, I could say that Nintendo diversifies more them incomes than EA sports. The proportion of the sales by region said to me that if I want to develop and sell a video game I will be promoted more in North America than another region because they consume more videogames.
